# Copilot Instructions

To ensure code quality and maintainability in this repository, Copilot must follow these rules:

1. **Type Annotations**:  
    All function arguments and return values should be explicitly typed whenever possible. Use Python's type hints to clarify expected types.

2. **Pythonic Code**:  
    Always prefer the most idiomatic and pythonic way of solving problems. Use built-in functions, comprehensions, context managers, and other standard Python features.

3. **Documentation**:  
    Every class and method must include clear and concise docstrings that explain their purpose, parameters, and return values. Follow PEP 257 conventions for docstrings.

4. **Documentation Review**:  
    If any code changes, ensure that the corresponding documentation is reviewed and updated to reflect those changes.

5. **Black Linter Compliance**:  
    Format all code according to the [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) linter guidelines. Avoid any code that would generate warnings or errors from Black.

By following these rules, we ensure that our codebase remains clean, readable, and maintainable.
